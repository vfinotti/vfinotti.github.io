Research engineer at Center for Scientific Computing (NCC/Unesp) and Master's student at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Currently working with convolutional neural networks implementation on FPGA's (on my Master's) and with the development of back-end electronics for the Phase-2 tracker upgrade of the CMS detector (on NCC/Unesp). Interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, embedded systems, statistics and homebrewing.

### Experience

I have worked in scientific experiments since my graduation. My internship was developed at the Brazilian Light Source, at the Beam Diagnostics Group, where I worked with the HDL, signal processing and automation of instruments and hardware tests. Shortly after, I started to collaborate on the developments for the CMS detector upgrade, focusing on FPGA development, high-speed data transmission and general electronics evaluation/debugging. You may find more about my professional expertise on my LinkedIn page.
